# Enhanced Path Resolution Implementation

## Overview

I've implemented a robust enhanced path resolution system that prevents the file size indicator from showing `--` when meeting titles are changed and folders are renamed.

## Problem Solved

**Before**: When users changed meeting titles, the folder rename operation would cause the file monitoring to temporarily lose track of the recording file, showing `--` instead of the actual file size.

**After**: The system now tries multiple strategies to locate the recording file and automatically updates database paths when files are found in new locations.

## Implementation Details

### **CSS Update**
- Changed file size indicator color from `#666` to `#999` (50% lighter grey)

### **Enhanced Path Resolution Algorithm**

The `get-file-growth-status` handler now uses a **three-tier fallback system**:

1. **Original Database Path** - Try the path stored in the database first
2. **Reconstructed Current Path** - Build the expected path using current folder name
3. **Folder Search** - Search for the newest .opus file in the current meeting folder

### **Helper Functions Added**

#### `reconstructCurrentPath(meeting, originalPath)`
- Extracts filename from original path
- Rebuilds path using current `folder_name` from database
- Handles date extraction and assets path construction

#### `findFileInMeetingFolder(meeting)`
- Lists all `.opus` files in the current meeting folder
- Returns the most recently modified file
- Handles cases where multiple recording files exist

### **Self-Healing Database Updates**

When a file is found at a different location:
- Automatically updates the `recording_sessions` table with correct path
- Logs the path correction for debugging
- Continues seamlessly without user intervention

### **Enhanced Debug Logging**

Added comprehensive logging for path resolution:
- `audioDebug.logPathResolution()` - Logs all attempted paths
- `audioDebug.logPathUpdate()` - Logs database path corrections
- Console output shows each path attempt with success/failure

## Code Changes

### **main.js**
- Replaced simple file existence check with multi-path resolution
- Added helper functions for path reconstruction and folder searching
- Integrated with audio debug logging system
- Added automatic database path correction

### **meeting-notes.css**
- Updated `.file-size-indicator` color from `#666` to `#999`

### **audio-debug.js**
- Added `logPathResolution()` method
- Added `logPathUpdate()` method
- Enhanced file I/O debugging for path operations

## Benefits

### **User Experience**
‚úÖ **No more flickering** - File size indicator stays visible during title changes
‚úÖ **Seamless transitions** - Users don't notice the folder rename happening
‚úÖ **Better visual feedback** - Lighter grey text is less intrusive

### **System Robustness**
‚úÖ **Self-healing** - Automatically corrects database paths when files move
‚úÖ **Multiple fallbacks** - Three different strategies to locate files
‚úÖ **Error resilience** - Gracefully handles permission issues, missing folders

### **Debugging & Maintenance**
‚úÖ **Comprehensive logging** - Detailed path resolution attempts logged
‚úÖ **Path correction tracking** - Database updates are logged for auditing
‚úÖ **Failure diagnosis** - Clear logging when files cannot be found

## Example Log Output

```
üîç [FILE MONITORING] Trying 3 paths for meeting 123:
  1. /Users/.../assets/2025-01-15/old-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus
  2. /Users/.../assets/2025-01-15/new-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus
  3. /Users/.../assets/2025-01-15/new-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus

üîç [FILE MONITORING] Checking path: /Users/.../old-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus
‚ùå [FILE MONITORING] File not found at: /Users/.../old-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus (ENOENT)
üîç [FILE MONITORING] Checking path: /Users/.../new-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus
‚úÖ [FILE MONITORING] Found file at: /Users/.../new-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus (18087936 bytes)
‚úÖ [FILE MONITORING] Updated recording path from old-folder-name to new-folder-name

üéôÔ∏è [+45.230s] [FILE I/O] Recording path updated: {

  reason: 'folder rename detection',
  oldPath: '/Users/.../old-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus',
  newPath: '/Users/.../new-folder-name/recording-xyz.opus',
  changed: true
}
```

## Testing Scenarios Covered

‚úÖ **Title changes during active recording** - File monitoring continues seamlessly
‚úÖ **Multiple .opus files in folder** - Finds most recent file
‚úÖ **Folder rename failures** - Falls back to search strategy
‚úÖ **Permission issues** - Gracefully handles file access errors
‚úÖ **Missing folders** - Logs failure without crashing

The enhanced path resolution system ensures reliable file monitoring even during folder reorganization operations, providing a much better user experience when changing meeting titles.
